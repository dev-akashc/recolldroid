RecollDroid is an Android front end to the Recoll full text search engine typically used
to index all of your desktop/server files.  For more information on Recoll, see
https://www.recoll.org

RecollDroid consists of an andriod ui and a thin server layer providing a RestAPI interface
to the Recoll software.  It uses Recoll's python API and supports multiple users securely
via basic auth over https.

The server layer makes use of FastAPI to provide the restful endpoints for the UI.  It
contains no authentication code itself but depends on a proxying layer to ensure only
validated users can connect.  The supported setup is to use the Nginx reverse proxy to
perform basic auth together with the unit app server to host the recoll rest api.
